# Contributing

## Development workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Make your changes. Keep them focused — one change per branch.
3. Test locally: `python -m py_compile wechatbridge/*.py` and `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` (or the project test entry you use).
4. **If the change is user-visible** (behavior, fix, feature, user-facing copy, config defaults that affect runtime) — see **Mandatory version bump** below. Do **not** merge code-only commits without a version bump.
5. Open a pull request against `main`. Include a summary of what changed and why.

## Code style

- Python 3.10+.
- Keep functions short and focused on one task.
- Avoid adding dependencies without discussion.
- Log with context — include `user_id`, prompt summary, or error details.

## Version and compatibility strategy

### Semantic versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** — incompatible API, behaviour, or configuration changes (deleting a config key, changing message handling semantics, breaking existing deployments).
- **MINOR** — backward-compatible new features (new slash command, new message type support, new config option).
- **PATCH** — backward-compatible bug fixes.

Breaking changes MUST bump MAJOR. They must not be smuggled into MINOR or PATCH releases.

### Mandatory version bump (one change → one patch)

**Rule (enforced):** any commit that changes **user-visible** behavior, fixes, features, or runtime-facing copy **must** raise `__version__`. Shipping package/code changes under the same version as the previous release tag is **forbidden**.

- **One substantive cut → one patch** (`1.3.4`, `1.3.5`, …). Rising to a high patch number is fine; silent same-version deploys are not.
- Pure docs-only edits (README/CONTRIBUTING/comments with no package behavior change) do **not** require a bump.
- Changes under `wechatbridge/` (and behavioral tests that document a product change) **do** require a bump relative to the latest `vX.Y.Z` tag.

**Per-change flow (same PR / same release cut):**

1. Bump `__version__` in `wechatbridge/__init__.py` only (never hardcode version in `pyproject.toml`).
2. Add a **formal** CHANGELOG section `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` with the real notes. Do **not** leave user-visible work stacked under `[Unreleased]` for long — close it into a versioned section when you cut the change.
3. Commit (message may be `release: wechatbridge vX.Y.Z …` or a focused fix that includes the bump).
4. Create an **annotated** tag `vX.Y.Z` and push the branch **and** the tag (tag push triggers PyPI).

### Version check (run before push / in CI)

```bash
python scripts/check_version_bump.py
```

What it does:

- Reads `__version__` from `wechatbridge/__init__.py`.
- Finds the latest git tag matching `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.
- If any **package-relevant** paths changed since that tag (`wechatbridge/**`, `pyproject.toml`, or non-doc test changes), requires `__version__` **strictly greater** than the tagged version and a `## [X.Y.Z]` section in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Exit `0` when OK, non-zero when a bump was missed.

CI runs the same script on pushes/PRs to `main` (`.github/workflows/version-check.yml`).

### Deprecated environment variables

When renaming an environment variable, add the old name → new name mapping to `wechatbridge/config.py`'s `_DEPRECATED_ENV` dict. The old name will continue to work with a deprecation warning for at least **one minor version** before removal.

### Feature flags

Experimental or optional features are gated behind `WECHATBRIDGE_ENABLE_*` environment variables. Follow the existing pattern (e.g. `WECHATBRIDGE_ENABLE_MCP`, `WECHATBRIDGE_ENABLE_SUBAGENT`):

- Default to `true` for stable features that most users want.
- Default to `false` for truly experimental features.
- The flag should be checked at the entry point of the feature, and the feature should degrade gracefully when disabled.

### Prefs structure migrations

User preferences (per-user, per-backend) are stored as nested dicts and normalized in `runner_common.py`'s `normalize_prefs()`. If you change the prefs structure (add/rename/remove keys), update `normalize_prefs()` so that old persisted prefs are migrated automatically on load. This avoids manual migration steps during upgrades.

### Version source of truth

The canonical version string lives in `wechatbridge/__init__.py` as `__version__`. Since 1.3.0, `pyproject.toml` uses `dynamic = ["version"]` and reads it via `[tool.setuptools.dynamic]` (`version = {attr = "wechatbridge.__version__"}`). Only ever change the version in `__init__.py`.

## Release process

Releases are semi-automated. For every user-visible cut:

1. **Update the version** — change `__version__` in `wechatbridge/__init__.py` to the new version (patch by default).
2. **Update CHANGELOG** — write `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` with the notes for this cut; keep a fresh empty `[Unreleased]` heading above it. Prefer closing notes into the versioned section in the same change, not a long-lived Unreleased pile.
3. **Verify** — `python scripts/check_version_bump.py` and tests.
4. **Commit, tag, and push** — annotated tag `vX.Y.Z`, then push branch and tag:

   ```bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin main
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

The tag push triggers the `.github/workflows/release.yml` workflow which:

- Verifies the tag matches `__version__`.
- Builds the package and publishes it to **PyPI** via [trusted publishing](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/).
- Extracts the `[X.Y.Z]` section from `CHANGELOG.md` and creates a **GitHub Release** with it.

Users then see the new version via `pipx upgrade wechatbridge-cli`, the built-in update check, and `wechatbridge --version`.

### One-time PyPI setup (already configured 2026-07-26 — reference for re-setup)

If the trusted publisher or GitHub environment ever needs to be recreated:

1. On [PyPI project settings](https://pypi.org/manage/project/wechatbridge-cli/settings/) (for the very first publish of a new project, use the account-level [pending publisher](https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/) page instead):
   - Add a **trusted publisher** with:
     - Repository: `dorokuma/wechatbridge`
     - Workflow: `release.yml` — must match the workflow **file name** exactly (`release.yml`, not `release.yaml`, not the display name `Release`)
     - Environment: `pypi`
2. On GitHub repository:
   - Created an environment called `pypi` (no secrets needed — trusted publishing uses OIDC).

### Recommended upgrade path for users (document in CHANGELOG if breaking)

```bash
pipx upgrade wechatbridge-cli && sudo systemctl restart wechatbridge
```

Or via the deploy script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dorokuma/wechatbridge/main/deploy/update.sh | sudo bash
```

If the service runs as a dedicated system user (e.g. `wechatbridge`), set `WECHATBRIDGE_USER` so the script upgrades that user's pipx installation.

If the release contains breaking changes, write a clear **Migration** subsection in the CHANGELOG entry.
